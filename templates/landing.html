        <h2>Understand your portfolio</h2>

        <p>Are you as diversified as you think?
            Does your allocation match your long term plans?
            Are certain positions underperforming?
            See how different positions contributed to your portfolio over time.
            Uncorrelated investments add overall stability to your portfolio.</p>

        <h2>Easily compute your investment gains</h2>
        <p>Things can get complex easily if you have sold investments you've been buying
            in a different currency than the one you are doing the taxes in. You also need
            to track how much each share cost you and deal with annoying things like stock splits.
            It's easy to mess this stuff up without software to help you.

            Track your dividends, contributions and growth
        </h2>
        <p>
            How much dividends did you get this year?
            How much of your portfolio growth was due to your contributions vs dividends vs investment growth?
            Track this easily even if you use multiple brokers.

        <h2>Plan and execute</h2>
        <p>Ever planned to sell a stock when it reached certain value or age? Set yourself alerts when your portfolio
            matches certain criteria.
            This can be helpful for rebalancing your portfolio, selling a value investment that
            now appears overpriced
            or optimizing your taxes.

        <h2>Financial modeling for retirement</h2>
        <p>
            When will your portfolio be enough to retire on? How much could you withdraw without risking running out of
            money?
            Sadly, Invertimo won't predict the future for you, but can help you model various scenarios and track your
            withdrawals.
